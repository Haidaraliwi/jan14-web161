            <p>Web accessibility
                Web accessibility means making your website usable for people who might have barriers to accessing it. Typically it's associated with making your website usable by people with blindness or other visual disabilities, but in a general sense, it means making a website that can be used by people accessing it with a device other than the typical visual screens most people use. Often these devices are screen readers, which parse the underlying code of a website and read it aloud to a user.
                Making a website accessible usually requires fixing issues in the underlying code that don't show up as issues to users on visual screens. For example, some web pages rely on images to convey meaning, whether it's by using icons to indicate how to navigate the site, or by having an article that relies heavily on embedded pictures. For users on screens, these don't present a problem, but screen readers can't interpret icons or pictures. In these cases, there are ways to provide text alternatives to the graphical elements so that the screen reader can make sense of the page.
                The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities. An accessible Web can also help people with disabilities more actively participate in society.
                The Web offers the possibility of unprecedented access to information and interaction for many people with disabilities. That is, the accessibility barriers to print, audio, and visual media can be much more easily overcome through Web technologies.
                The document "Social Factors in Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization" discusses how the Web impacts the lives of people with disabilities, the overlap with digital divide issues, and Web accessibility as an aspect of corporate social responsibility.
                Another important consideration for organizations is that Web accessibility is required by laws and policies in some cases. WAI Web Accessibility Policy Resources links to resources for addressing legal and policy factors within organizations, including a list of relevant laws and policies around the world.
